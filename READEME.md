# A Chat App

- This is the code that runs my chat app which you can view at http://68.183.31.37:80
- This code has been modified to run on the local machine.
- This has a WebApp and an Electron made desktop app.
- I used Flask to handle the HTTP requests and used SQLite for the database.
- This is my first time making a WeAapp so expect some bugs and issues in the code.
